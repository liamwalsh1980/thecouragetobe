                I am qualified at diploma level in Integrative counselling. This means that we will draw upon techniques 
                from a variety of models and approaches as we explore issues that you, the client, may bring to therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                To anyone new to counselling this may sound a daunting prospect and the fear and anxiety of engaging with 
                an ‘expert’ may seem overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My personal focus is on the client-counsellor relationship that I believe is the over-riding and most 
                important contribution to positive growth, change and self-acceptance; you are the expert, I bring the expertise.
            </p>
            <p>As well as my passion for the Person-Centred approach I have a deep interest in the search for meaning in one’s life. 
                Together we can explore the anxieties that life inevitably lays upon each one of us.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am experienced working within the education sector, supporting children and their families with whatever issues they 
                bring to our sessions. These may include difficulties with attachment, self-esteem, bereavement & loss, domestic 
                violence, family breakdown and the countless other challenges that come with living today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a clinical supervisor; working with other professionals on their cases as well as their personal and professional well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                I practice in South-West Birmingham as well as meeting clients in their place of work or other suitable settings. I do home visits.

                <p>
                    The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) defines counselling and psychotherapy as:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                    "...umbrella terms that cover a range of talking therapies. They are delivered by trained practitioners who 
                    work with people over a short or long term to help them bring about effective change or enhance their well-being."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim of a professionally trained counsellor is to help clients to uncover feelings, memories, judgements 
                    (self and by others) that are somehow preventing a more fulfilled, self-accepting life.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    To anyone new to counselling this may sound a daunting prospect and the fear and anxiety of engaging with an ‘expert’ 
                    may seem overwhelming. Having sat in both chairs, so to speak, I understand the possible fears of being 'overpowered' 
                    as well as the dread of being judged. An effective and self-aware counsellor will work hard to ensure that she or he 
                    doesn't add to your difficulties by being judgemental or overbearing. However, these feelings can be useful areas for 
                    exploration.

                        Holding a Diploma in Clinical Supervision, I practice supervision and staff care within the professions of counselling 
                        and the education sector. My experience and expertise, coupled with my chosen approach (Proctor’s Model of Clinical​ 
                        Supervision) enables my work to be fully transferable to other professions and disciplines. The ‘Restorative’ facet of 
                        the model is particularly effective in allowing an individual to feel empowered and valued - often all that is needed 
                        for emotional efficacy and enhanced motivation.
