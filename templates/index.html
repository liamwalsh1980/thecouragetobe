                I am qualified at diploma level in Integrative counselling. This means that we will draw upon techniques 
                from a variety of models and approaches as we explore issues that you, the client, may bring to therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                To anyone new to counselling this may sound a daunting prospect and the fear and anxiety of engaging with 
                an ‘expert’ may seem overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My personal focus is on the client-counsellor relationship that I believe is the over-riding and most 
                important contribution to positive growth, change and self-acceptance; you are the expert, I bring the expertise.
            </p>
            <p>As well as my passion for the Person-Centred approach I have a deep interest in the search for meaning in one’s life. 
                Together we can explore the anxieties that life inevitably lays upon each one of us.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am experienced working within the education sector, supporting children and their families with whatever issues they 
                bring to our sessions. These may include difficulties with attachment, self-esteem, bereavement & loss, domestic 
                violence, family breakdown and the countless other challenges that come with living today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a clinical supervisor; working with other professionals on their cases as well as their personal and professional well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                I practice in South-West Birmingham as well as meeting clients in their place of work or other suitable settings. I do home visits.

                <p>
                    The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) defines counselling and psychotherapy as:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                    "...umbrella terms that cover a range of talking therapies. They are delivered by trained practitioners who 
                    work with people over a short or long term to help them bring about effective change or enhance their well-being."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim of a professionally trained counsellor is to help clients to uncover feelings, memories, judgements 
                    (self and by others) that are somehow preventing a more fulfilled, self-accepting life.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    To anyone new to counselling this may sound a daunting prospect and the fear and anxiety of engaging with an ‘expert’ 
                    may seem overwhelming. Having sat in both chairs, so to speak, I understand the possible fears of being 'overpowered' 
                    as well as the dread of being judged. An effective and self-aware counsellor will work hard to ensure that she or he 
                    doesn't add to your difficulties by being judgemental or overbearing. However, these feelings can be useful areas for 
                    exploration.

                    <p>
                        Holding a Diploma in Clinical Supervision, I practice supervision and staff care within the professions of counselling 
                        and the education sector. My experience and expertise, coupled with my chosen approach (Proctor’s Model of Clinical​ 
                        Supervision) enables my work to be fully transferable to other professions and disciplines. The ‘Restorative’ facet of 
                        the model is particularly effective in allowing an individual to feel empowered and valued - often all that is needed 
                        for emotional efficacy and enhanced motivation.
