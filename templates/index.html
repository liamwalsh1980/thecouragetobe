                I am qualified at diploma level in Integrative counselling. This means that we will draw upon techniques 
                from a variety of models and approaches as we explore issues that you, the client, may bring to therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                To anyone new to counselling this may sound a daunting prospect and the fear and anxiety of engaging with 
                an ‘expert’ may seem overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My personal focus is on the client-counsellor relationship that I believe is the over-riding and most 
                important contribution to positive growth, change and self-acceptance; you are the expert, I bring the expertise.
            </p>
            <p>As well as my passion for the Person-Centred approach I have a deep interest in the search for meaning in one’s life. 
                Together we can explore the anxieties that life inevitably lays upon each one of us.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am experienced working within the education sector, supporting children and their families with whatever issues they 
                bring to our sessions. These may include difficulties with attachment, self-esteem, bereavement & loss, domestic 
                violence, family breakdown and the countless other challenges that come with living today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a clinical supervisor; working with other professionals on their cases as well as their personal and professional well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                I practice in South-West Birmingham as well as meeting clients in their place of work or other suitable settings. I do home visits.
